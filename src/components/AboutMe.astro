        My name is Valentin, and I am 24 years old. My first contact with programming was at UNICEN in Tandil, where I built a <strong>strong foundation in programming.</strong>
        I particularly enjoyed the web architecture course, which initially guided me towards becoming a back-end developer. Over time, I evolved into a <strong><em>full stack developer</em> </strong>

        I have a passion for sports and have been practicing calisthenics for 2 years. ðŸ’ª<strong></strong>
    </p>

        Currently, I am validating a project "Cooper". My goal is to develop a digital platform that enhances the business, providing a unique opportunity to further develop my programming skills and contribute to a meaningful project.
